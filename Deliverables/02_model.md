The Economy
===========

Overview
--------

In this model, the economy consists of three types of agents (the set of
agents is denoted by ùíú), each of discrete measure:

ùíú‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ&lt;{‚Ñã<sub>*h*</sub>}<sub>*h*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ*H*</sub>,‚ÄÜ{‚Ñ¨<sub>*b*</sub>}<sub>*b*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ*B*</sub>,‚ÄÜ{‚Ñ∞}<sub>*e*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ*E*</sub>&gt;

Where the three types are:

-   households (‚Ñã), numbering *H*, with a typical member *h*;
-   banks (‚Ñ¨), numbering *B* with a typical member *b*;
-   and firms (or entrepreneurs - ‚Ñ∞), numbering *E*, with a typical
    member *e*.

There are also two goods - a consumption good *c* (which also serves
also as a store of value and a numeraire), and a production good
(capital - *k*). Households are endowed with labor units *l*, while
firms have access to a production technology ("projects" - described
below), that allows them to convert units of the consumption good into
units of the production good. The total amount of labor *L*, and the
total amount of capital *K*, can be combined to produce units of the
consumption good, by the production function *A**F*(*K*,‚ÄÜ*L*). After
production owners of capital and labor receive the respective rental
rate (*r*) and wage rate (*w*) in terms of units of *c*.

Households choose how much to consume each period, for which they
receive utility *u*(*c*), and how much to save. It is assumed that
households and firms cannot interact directly. Instead savers can choose
to deposit savings in a intermediary (bank). In return the bank pays a
per-period interest on savings. Firms interact with banks by taking out
loan contracts (in terms of *c*) and repaying interest. It is assumed
that banks are free to engage into loan contracts among each other,
while other agents can only engage with banks (the implementation
mechanism is explained into detail below).

Firms can use their funds (either earned through return to capital or
loaned from banks) to invest into projects. A project is a technology
that requires a fixed up-front investment of consumption good and which
returns a stochastic flow of units of the investment good. It is assumed
that each unit of the investment good produced is immediately devoted to
production of the final good.

The following diagram summarizes the process:

Interactions
------------

Each period of the economy consists of a series of interactions between
agents (or between agents and environment). The turn in which this
interactions happen is as follows:

> 1.  Interest payments on outstanding loans from firms to banks, from
>     banks to banks, and from banks to households (in that order) are
>     repaid. Any new overnight loans (if needed and if available) are
>     taken out. Any potential insolvencies are resolved. Banks with
>     reserves exceeding their own 'reserve target' pay out dividends
>     equal to the excess reserves over the target.
> 2.  Each bank decides
>
> -   Whether and by how much to change the interest rate offered on
>     deposits
> -   Whether and by how much to change the interest rate offered on
>     loans
> -   Whether and by how much to change the target (or desired) reserve
>     rate
>
> 1.  Banks decide whether to open overnigh-credit lines among each
>     other.
> 2.  Each household examines all of its outstanding deposits and
>     decides whether to wtihdraw it or not.
> 3.  Each household gets matched with three random banks and decides
>     whether to invest its available funds in any of it at the current
>     deposit rate. Everything not invested is consumed.
> 4.  Each firm is randomly matched with a project. The firm then
>     decides whether to keep the project or discard it. Each firm that
>     decides to keep the project and has enough funds to invest in it
>     does so.
> 5.  Firms that decide to keep the project but don't have enough funds
>     to invest are randomly matched with three banks. They then chose
>     to which of the three to apply for a loan (at the current loan
>     interest rate).
> 6.  Banks that have received a loan application make a yes/no decision
>     on each application. If approved the firm receives a fixed-payment
>     loan on the current loan interest rate, with a maturity defined by
>     the project duration.
> 7.  Banks with excess reserves decide whether and how much divident to
>     distribute (in discrete porportion of the total amount of excess
>     reserves)
> 8.  Each project yields units of the production good for the firm that
>     owns it
> 9.  All units of labor and of te production good are invested in final
>     good production. Firms and households receive factor income.

The following gives out more details about each step of the period:

### Step 0

At the very beginning of the period all interest payments from firm to
banks and from banks to households are made. This step is automatic and
does not require active decision making. On the firms side, since every
project undertaken from the firm is financed by at most one bank, the
repayment procedure can be expressed in pseudo-code as:

    for (firm in Firms):
      for (project in firm.projects):
        bank = project.bank
        payment = project.interest
        if (firm.assets > payment):
          firm.assets.decrease(payment)
          bank.assets.increase(payment)
        else:
          bank.assets.increase(firm.assets)
          firm.default()
        end if
      end for
    end for

Older loans are repaid first. If the firm cannot repay a loan a default
procedure ensues. When a firm defaults, all its projects are liquidated
(each project has a liquidation value). Banks that have given out loans
for each project then receive the liquidation amount (which could also
be 0). A defaulted stays inactive for four periods, after which it is
recapitalized (by the households) and resumes normal activity.

The process for payments from banks to depositors is similar. In the
case of a bank default, depositors get paid on a first come - first
serve basis. If a bank defaults it stays inactive indefinitely.

### Step 1

In the next step banks get to adjust the prices of their products. Each
bank has two products - a deposit offering, and a loan offering. It is
assumed that banks are restricted in their price adjustments, and can
only change the price incrementally in one period. More specifically,
each bank can either increase or decrease the offered interest rate for
a product by 0.1 or 0.05 percentage points in one period. The bank also
has the option to leave the price of a loan/deposit unchanged.

Banks also get to choose their 'desired' reserve ratio (expressed in %
of total liabilities). This is essentially capturing the banks' dividend
policy. If at the end of phase 0 of the next turn the bank has more than
this amount of reserves, it will pay out the excess as dividend. Similar
to interest rates, the target reserve percentage can only be changed in
increments.

We can express the options as follows:

    for (bank in Banks):
      bank sets deposit interest rate at one of:
        current rate - 0.05%
        current rate - 0.10%
        current rate
        current rate + 0.05%
        current rate + 0.10%
      bank sets loan rate at one of:
        current rate - 0.05%
        current rate - 0.10%
        current rate
        current rate + 0.05%
        current rate + 0.10%
      bank sets target reserve ratio as
        current ratio - 0.10%
        current ratio - 0.05%
        current rato
        current ratio + 0.05%
        current ratio + 0.10%
    end for

There are two reasons for choosing this price modification scheme. First
it ties into the framework of sticky prices that is often present in New
Keynesian models. Second, at more importantly perhaps, it allows for an
easier implementation of the agent's decision process described below.
Some may argue that this mode of price adjustment can be considered
unrealistic, but it is a limitation of the current modeling framework.

### Step 2

In this step each bank decides whether or not to extend an overnight
credit line to any other bank. The decision process goes as follows:

    for (loaner_bank in Banks):
      loaner_bank.close_all_credit_lines()
      for (borrower_bank in Banks):
        decision = loaner_bank.creditLineDecision(borrower_bank)
        if (decision == 1):
          loaner_bank.open_credit_line(borrower_bank)
        else:
          pass
        end if
      end for
    end for

Overnight credit lines play a role in step 3 of this turn, and step 0 of
the next turn. If after a bank has paid interest rate to depositors
(step 0), or after it has paid the principal on closed accounts (step
3), three things can happen:

-   The bank had enough reserves to carry out all payments and still be
    above the regulatory minimum reserve requirement
-   The bank had enough reserves to carry out all payments, but its
    reserves have dwindled below the minimum
-   The bank didn't have enough reserves to carry out all payments.

In the first case nothing happens, and in the third the bank goes into
insolvency (described below). In the second case the bank automatically
(no decision required) applies for an overnight loan. In this case if
any other bank has an open credit line to this distressed bank, it
automatically (again no decision) lends out the required difference in
order for the distressed bank to meet the reserve minimums (if more than
one bank has opened a credit line to the distressed bank, they share the
loan equally).

The terms of inter bank loans are exogenous to the model. The inter-bank
interest rate and the loan period (set to 1 or 2 periods) are decided on
by the analyst. This is at first glance a deficiency in the model, and
it is true that this approach was taken mainly to keep the model more
streamlined and tractable. However even this setup captures some
important aspects of real-life overnight loans, as the interest on this
loans is usually controlled by the monetary authority. Even though the
current version of the model does not have a monetary-authority-agent
that does open market operations, we will still adhere to the banks
taking the inter-bank rate as given. Furthermore, as some have pointed
out (citation needed), in the build up to the 2008 financial crisis many
banks chose not to lend in the inter bank market, even though rates were
high - showing that the choice to model the participation decision may
be appropriate.

### Step 3

The next step is straightforward - each households makes a series of
consecutive decisions (as many as the number of banks it has deposited
funds into) whether to withdraw a deposit or not. Funds from withdrawn
deposits are added to the households cash on hand.

    for (household in Households):
      for (bank in household.depositBanks):
        decision = household.withdrawDecision(bank)
        if (decision == True):
          amount = household.depositBanks.amount
          bank.deposits.decrease(amount)
          household.cash.increase(amount)
        end if
      end for
    end for

### Step 4

In the next step household decide where to deposit their cash on hand
(or whether to consume it). The process goes as follows:

    for (household in Households):
      matchedBanks = selectRandom(Banks, 3) # 3 random banks
      decision = household.DepositDecision(matchedBanks)
      if (decision == 0):
        household.consume(household.funds)
      else if (decision == 1):
        matchedBanks(1).deposits.increase(household.funds)
      else if (decision == 2):
        matchedBanks(2).deposits.increase(household.funds)
      else if (decision == 3):
        matchedBanks(3).deposits.increase(household.funds)
      end if
      household.funds = 0
    end for

Here it is assumed that households cannot decide to consume a part of
their cash on hand and invest the other. This is another limitation of
the implementation, since allowing for that decision would have
complicated the household part of the model significantly. Since the
focus is mostly on interactions with the banks (and not consumption
decisions per se) it was decided to limit the households' options in
that way.

It is worth noting however, that even with this setup households can
still smooth out intertemporal consumption in fine amounts by adjusting
their deposit holdings at each turn.

### Step 5

In this step firms receive a random draw of three potential projects to
invest in. Each project is characterized by:

-   a required up-front investment
-   a per-period mean return (in terms of the production good *k*),
-   per-period standard deviation of the return,
-   last-period mean return (again in terms of *k*),
-   standard deviation of the last-period return,
-   a liquidation value (in terms of *c*),
-   a 'sudden-stop' probability (hazard rate),
-   and a duration period.

Note the distinction between per-period return and last-period return.
Some projects will yield a steady stream of capital, while others will
yield a bulk amount at the end of their duration period. The firm can
then choose which project to invest in (it can also choose neither). If
the firm has available funds the project begins immediately. Otherwise a
loan is required.

If the firm decides not to invest in any project, then it is assumed
that all it's available funds are distributed as dividends, and
immediately consumed by the entrepreneur.

    for (firm in Firms):
      drawnProjects = selectRandom(Projects, 3)
      decision = firm.InvestmentDecision(drawnProjects)
      if (decision == 0):
        firm.divident(firm.funds)
      else if (decision == 1):
        if firm.funds > drawnProjects(1).upfront:
          firm.invest(drawnProjects(1))
        else:
          firm.loanApplication(drawnProjects(1))
        end if
      else if (decision == 2):
        if firm.funds > drawnProjects(2).upfront:
          firm.invest(drawnProjects(2))
        else:
          firm.loanApplication(drawnProjects(2))
        end if
      else if (decision == 3):
        if firm.funds > drawnProjects(3).upfront:
          firm.invest(drawnProjects(3))
        else:
          firm.loanApplication(drawnProjects(3))
        end if
      end if
    end for

### Step 6

This step is quite similar to the step where households decide where to
deposit their funds. Each firm gets randomly matched with 3 banks and
chooses to which one to apply for a loan. If the firm chooses neither,
the project is discarded, and the firm's available funds (if any) are
distributed as dividend.

    for (firm in Firms):
      matchedBanks = selectRandom(Banks, 3) # 3 random banks
      decision = firm.LoanDecision(matchedBanks)
      if (decision == 0):
        firm.divident(firm.funds)
      else if (decision == 1):
        matchedBanks(1).Applications.add(firm.loanApplication)
      else if (decision == 2):
        matchedBanks(2).Applications.add(firm.loanApplication)
      else if (decision == 3):
        matchedBanks(3).Applications.add(firm.loanApplication)
      end if
    end for

The only complication is, that if the firm chooses one of the matched
banks, the contract does not take effect immediately, but is subject to
approval from the bank as well. This happens in the next step.

### Step 7

In this step each bank makes a series of consecutive yes/no decisions
whether to accept or reject a loan application. If a loan application is
accepted, and if regulatory conditions for lending are met, then the
firm receives a fixed-per-period payment loan at the current lending
rate of the bank. The maturity of the loan is equal to the firm's
project duration. The loan amount is equal to the project up-front cost
(minus any funds that the firm already has).

    for (bank in Banks):
      for (application in bank.Applications):
        decision = bank.loanDecision(application)
        if (decision == True and meetsRegulations(application) == True):
          amount = application.amount
          bank.loans.increase(amount)
          application.firm.invest(application.project)
        end if
      end for
    end for

So far I have been vague about what 'regulatory requirements' means. To
clarify, each bank in the model must meet three requirements:

-   A capital adequacy requirement
-   A minimal reserve requirement
-   A loss provision requirement

What this requirements amount to is explained in the section detailing
bank agents below. A loan is extended only if, after lending the bank
will still meet all the requirements. Otherwise the loan is
automatically rejected.

### Step 8

After all lending is done, banks that have excess reserves (i.e.
reserves beyond the regulatory minimum) get to decide how much (if at
all) dividends to distribute. As every other decision in the model, the
action space of the banks is again discrete. It is assumed that they can
choose the percentage of excess reserves to be distributed in increments
of 20 percentage point:

    for (bank in Banks):
      if (bank.reserves < bank.minReserves):
        skip
      else:
        bank chooses one of:
          - distribute 0% of excess reserves as divident
          - distribute 20% of excess reserves as divident
          - distribute 40% of excess reserves as divident
          - distribute 60% of excess reserves as divident
          - distribute 80% of excess reserves as divident
          - distribute 100% of excess reserves as divident
      end if
    end for

As with firms, when a bank distributes dividends, it is assumed that
bank owners immediately consume them and receive the respective utility.

### Step 9

The final two steps of each turn are again automatic and don't require
agent input. In this step each project yields units of the capital good
for the firm. If the project is not in its final period, then the number
of units is equal to a draw from a log-normal distribution with mean and
standard deviation described by the projects per-period characteristics.
A project in its final period yields again a draw from a log-normal
distribution, but the mean and standard deviation are determined by the
corresponding final-period characteristics of the project.

More formally, if we denote *k*<sub>*p*</sub><sup>*e*</sup> the capital
that project *p* yields to firm *e*, and we let superscript *f* denote
final period quantities:

*k*<sub>*p*</sub><sup>*e*</sup>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ*l**o**g**N*(*Œº*,‚ÄÜ*œÉ*)

*k*<sub>*p*</sub><sup>*e*,‚ÄÜ*f*</sup>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ*l**o**g**N*(*Œº*<sup>*f*</sup>,‚ÄÜ*œÉ*<sup>*f*</sup>)

Each project also has a 'sudden-stop' probability. At this stage based
on a random draw the project might be destroyed pre-maturely. The firm
will no longer have this project in its assets and will not get further
yields from it.

### Step 10

In the final step firms invest all capital they have received at this
turn from active projects into production of the final good. Households
in turn devote their entire labor supply. It is assumed that final good
production is competitive, and factors are paid their marginal products.

$$
r\_t = \\frac{\\partial{A\_tF(K\_t,L\_t)}}{\\partial{K}}
$$

$$
w\_t = \\frac{\\partial{A\_tF(K\_t,L\_t)}}{\\partial{L}}
$$

The reason for this is that this part of the circular flow of the
economy is not the focus of the paper, and doesn't need to be modeled
explicitly. In fact we could have forgone aggregate production entirely,
by saying that projects directly produce the consumption good, and that
households only receive income through their savings. However the
introduction of aggregate production allows for simulating aggregate
shocks (via *A*<sub>*t*</sub>) and examining their effect on the credit
market.

Agents
======

As is evident from the above section, there are three decision-making
agents in this model - Households, Firms, and Banks. This section gives
out more details about each agent's state variables and their motives.

Households
----------

Households in this model own two assets - cash (units of the consumption
good), and bank deposits. They are also endowed with one (fixed) unit of
labor. Each period they receive consumption units through three streams
- labor income, interest payments, and deposit withdrawals. At the end
of the period their cash is either 1) invested in a bank deposit or 2)
consumed (with no option to invest part and consume another part).

Households have to make two type of decisions: whether to withdraw their
deposits or not (one decision per bank with deposits), and whether (and
where) to open a new deposit. Let's call all actions taken by an
individual household *h* over its lifetime
**Œò**<sub>*H*</sub><sup>*h*</sup>, and let
*Œò*<sub>*H*</sub><sup>*h*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sup> denote the actions taken in period
*t*. We have:

*Œò*<sub>*H*</sub><sup>*h*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sup>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ&lt;{*w*(*b*)}<sub>*b*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ*B*<sup>*h*</sup></sub>,‚ÄÜ*d*(*B*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*h*</sup>)&gt;

Where the set *B*<sup>*h*</sup> denotes all banks in which household *h*
currently has a deposit, each *w*(*b*) is a binary decision whether to
withdraw a deposit or not from bank *b*, *B*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*h*</sup>
is the set of randomly matched banks with household *h* at time *t*, and
*d*() is a 4-dimensional one-hot vector, indicating in which of the
three randomly-matched banks the consumer wants to deposit (the fourth
option is not to deposit anywhere and consume instead).

The household thus optimizes:

$$
\\max\_{\\Theta^h\_H}\\sum\_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\beta^t\_hu\_h(c^h\_t)
$$

Where *Œ≤* is a time preference discount factor (&lt;1), and *u* is a
utility function. For this initial model we assume all households have
the same *Œ≤* (the advantages of this will become apparent in the next
section), and the same *u* of the constant-elasticity-of-substitution
variety. *c*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*h*</sup> is the period *t* consumption
of household *i*, which is nothing more than the total cash-on-hand if
the household chooses not to deposit, or 0 otherwise.

Since households have to make two types of decision, they will have two
policy functions - one for withdrawal, one for depositing - that will
map from the state of the economy to an action. We will denote the state
of the economy **S**. When the household makes its decision it can only
access some features of the state *X*<sup>*h*</sup>‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ**S** (these will
be described below). So the two policy functions are:

$$
\\pi^h\_w:&lt;X^h\_w,b&gt; \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\} \\\\
\\pi^h\_d:&lt;X^h\_d,B^h\_t&gt; \\rightarrow R^4
$$

*œÄ*<sub>*w*</sub><sup>*h*</sup> is the withdrawal decision function (it
maps into {0,‚ÄÜ1}, where 1 means withdraw funds from bank *b*, 0 means
keep the deposit). *œÄ*<sub>*d*</sub><sup>*h*</sup> is the deposit choice
function. It maps into the one-hot vectors in *R*<sup>4</sup>, where
(0,‚ÄÜ1,‚ÄÜ0,‚ÄÜ0)<sup>*T*</sup> for example means "invest in the second
member of *B*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*h*</sup>", and
(0,‚ÄÜ0,‚ÄÜ0,‚ÄÜ1)<sup>*T*</sup> means "consume current cash holdings".

Firms
-----

Firms (or entrepreneurs) in this model also own two types of assets -
cash and projects. While cash is just unit of the consumption goods,
projects represent future stochastic flows of the investment good. Firms
receive cash in the form of return to capital, and lose cash when they
invest in a new project, when they make loan repayments, or when they
give out dividend. We assume that firms are run by self-interested
entrepreneurs, who own the entire firm. Thus dividend can also be viewed
as consumption of the entrepreneur. Firms can also have liabilities, as
new projects that cannot be self-financed rely on bank loans.

Like households, firms also make two decisions. In their case - whether
to invest in the project they've been randomly matched with, and from
which of the randomly matched banks (if any) to take out a loan (if
needed). To put some formalism on this description, denoting
**Œò**<sub>*E*</sub><sup>*e*</sup> all decisions taken by firm *e* over
its lifetime, and by *Œò*<sub>*E*</sub><sup>*e*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sup> the decision
taken at period *t* we have:

*Œò*<sub>*E*</sub><sup>*e*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sup>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ&lt;*i*(*p*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*e*</sup>),*l*(*B*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*e*</sup>)&gt;

Here *p*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*e*</sup> denotes the project that the firm
got matched with at period *t*; *i* is a binary decision whether to
undertake the project; *B*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*e*</sup> is the set of
banks the firm randomly matched with, and *l* is a 4-dimensional one-hot
vector, showing which bank the firm chooses for their loan application
(again (0,‚ÄÜ0,‚ÄÜ0,‚ÄÜ1)<sup>*T*</sup> means neither of the available banks,
in which case the project is discarded.). Note, that if the firm has
enough cash to invest in *p*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*e*</sup> without a loan,
then the set of actions in that period is just
*Œò*<sub>*E*</sub><sup>*e*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sup>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ&lt;*i*(*p*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*e*</sup>)&gt;.

The entrepreneur is treated as an individual with a consumption function
and time preference similar to those of the households. Denote dividend
at time *t* to the owner of firm *e* (which is immediately consumed) as
*c*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*e*</sup>. The firm optimizes:

$$
\\max\_{\\Theta^e\_E}\\sum\_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\beta^t\_eu\_e(c^e\_t)
$$

Similar to households, firms also have two policy functions (one for
each decision). Denoting the features of the state that the firm sees as
*X*<sup>*e*</sup>, and the set of all projects *P*:

$$
\\pi^e\_i:&lt;X^h\_i,P&gt; \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\} \\\\
\\pi^e\_l:&lt;X^h\_l,B&gt; \\rightarrow R^4
$$

Unlike households, firms have liabilities and thus can default. If a
firm is unable to carry out interest payments it goes into default. All
its projects are liquidated (remember that each project has a
liquidation value), and the proceeds go out to the creditors. After a
set number of periods a new firm is created in the place of the
defaulted one.

Banks
-----

Banks are at the center of this model, and are thus the most complex
agent type. Banks are the only agent type that has a well-defined
balance sheet. It consists of assets - loans outstanding, required
reserves, excess reserves, and provisions; and liabilities - outstanding
deposits and equity.

When a bank issues a deposit, its deposit liabilities increase with the
amount of the deposit. On the assets side the deposited units (units of
*c* which is also cash in this economy) either increase required
reserves (if they were below the regulatory minimum), or excess reserves
(otherwise). When a deposit is withdrawn, deposit liabilities decrease,
as well as reserves.

When a bank issues a loan, its loan outstanding increase by the amount
of the loan, its provisions increase with the amount of the loan times
the regulatory required provision percent, and its reserves decrease
with the sum of the two. When a bank receives a loan repayment, or pays
out deposit interest, it comes in (or out) the bank's reserves. Equity
is defined as Total Assets - Non-equity Liabilities, so it also changes
correspondingly with loan/deposit interest repayments.

Note that provisions enter the balance sheet with a negative side (since
they are meant to represent expected losses), so whenever they change,
so does equity. When a loan defaults, it is written off the books, the
bank gains cash equal to the liquidation value, provisions decline with
the amount of the loss, and if provisions run out, equity also
decreases.

If at the beginning of the period (step 0), the bank has more excess
reserves than its target (the target is in terms of percentage of
required reserves), the bank pays out dividend. This decreases excess
reserves and equity.

The three regulatory parameters, that the bank has to oblige to are:

-   required reserve ratio (*R**R*),
-   capital adequacy ratio (*C**R*),
-   per-loan provision ratio (*P**R*).

These three policy parameters are the cornerstone of the model - the end
goal is to examine how the simulated economy reacts to any of them.
Required reserves are defined in terms of percentage of outstanding
deposits. The capital minimal adequacy ratio is defined in terms of the
ratio between capital and total loans outstanding. Provisions are
defined as a percentage of the total loan amount.

Whenever a bank wants to make a loan, an automatic check is carried out
whether after the loan amount is lent, and the expected loss is
provisioned for, the bank's reserve and capital adequacy ratios still
meet the required minima. If not, the loan is rejected despite the banks
decision. Whenever a banks capital adequacy ratio falls below the
minimum it is in distress, and cannot make further loans before
improving its balance position.

Note, that all loans are treated as equally risky in the definitions
above. This is of course not true, but the elaboration of these
regulatory requirements is left for future extensions.

Each bank in the model makes a total of five different decision types in
each period: how to change the interest rate on deposits and loans, by
how much to change the excess reserve target, to which other banks to
extend overnight credit lines, and which loan applications to accept.
Similar to before we denote **Œò**<sub>**B**</sub><sup>**b**</sup> the
set of all decisions bank *b* makes throughout its lifetime, and
*Œò*<sub>*B*</sub><sup>*b*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sup> the decisions taken at time *t*. We
have:

*Œò*<sub>*B*</sub><sup>*b*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sup>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ&lt;*r*<sup>*d*</sup>,‚ÄÜ*r*<sup>*l*</sup>,‚ÄÜ*r**e**s*,‚ÄÜ{*c**l*(*b*‚Ä≤)}<sub>*b*‚Ä≤‚àà*B*</sub>,‚ÄÜ{*a*(*p*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*e*</sup>,‚ÄÜ*e*)}<sub>*e*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ*E*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*b*</sup></sub>&gt;

Here *r*<sup>*d*</sup>, and *r*<sup>*l*</sup> are five-dimensional
one-hot vectors denoting the incremental change in interest rates on
deposits and loans respectively ((0,‚ÄÜ1,‚ÄÜ0,‚ÄÜ0,‚ÄÜ0)<sup>*T*</sup> for
example is "decrease by 0.05%", while (0,‚ÄÜ0,‚ÄÜ1,‚ÄÜ0,‚ÄÜ0)<sup>*T*</sup> is
"don't change"). *r**e**s* is a similarly encoded vector for the
incremental change in target excess reserves. *c**l*(*b*‚Ä≤) is a binary
decision whether to open (or keep open) a credit line to bank *b*‚Ä≤, and
*a*(*p*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*e*</sup>,‚ÄÜ*e*) is a binary decision whether
to approve a loan to firm *e* for financing project
*p*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*e*</sup> (*E*<sub>*t*</sub><sup>*b*</sup> is the
set of all firms that have applied for a loan to bank *b* at period
*t*).

The bank, similar to the firms, is owned by a self-interested
entrepreneur, with their own utility function and discount factor. All
dividends accrue to the entrepreneur and are consumed immediately.
Denoting those dividends *c*<sub>*b*</sub>, bank *b*'s optimization
problem is:

$$
\\max\_{\\Theta^b\_B}\\sum\_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\beta^t\_b u\_b(c^b\_t)
$$

The five decisions require five policy functions. Denoting the part of
the state space, available to the bank as *X*<sup>*b*</sup> we have:

$$
\\pi^b\_{r^d}: &lt;X^b\_{r^d}&gt; \\rightarrow R^5 \\\\
\\pi^b\_{r^l}: &lt;X^b\_{r^l}&gt; \\rightarrow R^5 \\\\
\\pi^b\_{res}: &lt;X^b\_{res}&gt; \\rightarrow R^5 \\\\
\\pi^b\_{cl}: &lt;X^b\_{res},B&gt; \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}\\\\
\\pi^b\_{a}: &lt;X^b\_{r^d},E, P&gt; \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\} 
$$

Finally, when a bank defaults, all its assets are liquidated. This means
that projects that were financed by the bank seize prematurely and pay
their liquidation value. After this all cash available to the bank gets
paid to depositors at a first-come first-serve basis. Finally the bank
seizes to exist and after a (longer) fixed amount of time a new bank is
created. The new bank's initial capital is taken in equal amount as a
share from each household's labor income over the inactive period.
However the households do not own the bank (it is still owned by a self
interested entrepreneur).

Decision Making
===============

So far I have been purposefully elusive when it comes to the agents
decision making process. In a traditional economic model, one will go
ahead by defining a dynamic programming problem, finding an optimal plan
of action for each agent type and analyzing the results. However the
model presented above already contains enough moving parts to be close
to unfeasible to deal with (exact) optimization techniques. This is the
case because the dynamics of the system are quite complicated -
involving three type of agents, each individual agent having a different
asset position at every single time. In this light I assume that the
agents in the model are boundedly rational, and solve their respective
optimization problems in an approximate manner.

To be more concrete, it is assumed that agents do not know their utility
function, but they can experience utility and know when and how much of
it they receive each turn. The agent thus interacts with its environment
(the economy) and observe the utility it gets after each set of actions.
Based on this feedback the agent updates its policy function. This is
the general optimization environment associated with reinforcement
learning. It can be presented schematically as follows:

![agent-environment interactions](visuals/Agent_Environment.png)

The next few sections give details on how the (approximate) optimal
policy is computed and updated. The same general process is used by all
agents for all their decisions, so I will give only one generic
description. The optimization algorithm described here is known as
double deep-Q learning (citation needed)

Q Values
--------

To begin with, define as *Q*<sup>*œÄ*</sup>(*S*,‚ÄÜ*a*) the infinite sum of
feature discounted utility starting from time *t*, received after taking
action *a* in state *S*, and following policy *œÄ* in any subsequent
period.. Denoting by *œÄ*(*S*) the action, that is taken in state *S*
following policy *œÄ*, *S*‚Ä≤ the action in the next period, and
*S*<sup>*t*</sup>‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ*œÄ* the infinite sequence of subsequent action, if
policy *œÄ* is followed, we have the following expressions for *Q*:

$$
Q^\\pi(S,a) = u\_t(S,a) + \\beta\\mathbf{E}\_{S^t \\sim \\pi}\\left\[\\sum\_{t=1}^{\\infty}u\_t(S^t,\\pi(S^t))\\right\] = u(S,a) + \\beta\\mathbf{E}\_{S^t \\sim \\pi}\\left\[Q^\\pi(S',\\pi(S'))\\right\]
$$

This quantity is known as the action value of *a*. It is similar to the
state value *V*<sup>*œÄ*</sup>(*S*), which denotes the feature sum of
discounted utility after visiting state *S* and following policy *œÄ*. In
fact, we have that

*V*<sup>*œÄ*</sup>(*S*)=*Q*<sup>*œÄ*</sup>(*S*,‚ÄÜ*œÄ*(*S*))

The *Q* value allows us to look at actions different then *œÄ*(*S*). If
an agent knows the value function *Q*<sup>*œÄ*</sup>, the he can improve
on the policy *œÄ* at state *S* by choosing the action:
max<sub>*a*</sub>*Q*<sup>*œÄ*</sup>(*S*,‚ÄÜ*a*). This result is known as
the policy improvement theorem (citation). Therefore, in theory, if the
agent can always compute the *Q* function for any policy *œÄ*, they can
successively improve on their policy and eventually find an optimal
policy *œÄ*<sup>\*</sup>. We call *Q*<sup>\*</sup> the *Q*-function
associated with *œÄ*<sup>\*</sup>.

Q Function Approximation
------------------------

In classical dynamic programming we would have focused on finding this
*Q*<sup>\*</sup>, and we would have made our agents choose the action,
that maximizes *Q*<sup>\*</sup> every time they had to act (that is, to
behave according to *œÄ*<sup>\*</sup>. However, as has already been
mentioned, computing the expectation in the action Bellman equation is
next to impossible in a environment as complex as the one currently
analyzed. Instead, agents are boudnedly rational, and try to find the
best approximation to *Q*<sup>\*</sup>.

To that end, I define the differentiable function *Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>
(parametrized by *œï*) as the agent's current approximation to
*Q*<sup>\*</sup>. Every time the agent is called to take an action in
state *S* then, they choose
*a**r**g*max<sub>*a*</sub>*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*S*,‚ÄÜ*a*). As the agent
interacts with the environment, they learn how to update the function
*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>, so that it approximates *Q*<sup>\*</sup> better and
better.

To describe the algorithm to do this, imagine that the agent interacts
with the environment for *N* periods, following some policy. Let
*S*<sub>*i*</sub>, *a*<sub>*i*</sub> for *i*‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1,‚ÄÜ2,‚ÄÜ..*N* denote the
states encountered, and the actions taken. Define the Bellman error at
state *S*<sub>*i*</sub>, after action *a*<sub>*i*</sub> as:
*Œª*<sub>*i*</sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)‚àí*u*(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)+*Œ≤**V*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*s*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>)=*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)‚àí*u*(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)‚àí*Œ≤*max<sub>*a*</sub>*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*S*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>)

Looking back at the definition of *Q*<sub>*œï*</sub> it is evident, that
the Bellman error measures the 'surprise' of the agent - the difference
between the expected sum of feature utility before the action is taken,
and the expected sum of future utility ex-post (when the immediate
utility and the new state *S*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub> are observed). We want to
update the parameters such as to minimize this 'surprise' (a.k.a to make
the agent better at forecasting the consequences of each action). A
simple algorithm to do this is:

1.  Collect data
    (*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*S*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*u*(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>))
2.  Set
    *y*<sub>*i*</sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ*u*(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)+*Œ≤*max<sub>*a*‚Ä≤</sub>*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*S*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>)
3.  Set
    *œï*‚ÄÑ‚Üê‚ÄÑ*a**r**g*min<sub>*œï*</sub>‚àë<sub>*i*</sub>||*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)‚àí*y*<sub>*i*</sub>||<sup>2</sup>

Where step 2. and 3. are repeated K times (think of value function
iteration with sampling). This is little more than fitting a regression
to *y*<sub>*i*</sub> as defined above.

The algorithm described above will achieve its goal, however we want to
be able to make updates to the approximate *Q* function (and therefore
to the policy function *œÄ*) online. That is, after each interaction with
the environment, so that our agents are adaptable to changes in the
economy. We can do this by taking a gradient descent step for
*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub> after each period. Letting the learning rate of the
gradient descent be denoted as *Œ≥* the algorithm becomes:

1.  Take an action *a*<sub>*i*</sub> at state *S*<sub>*i*</sub> and
    record
    *S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*S*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*u*(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)
2.  Calculate the Bellman error
    *Œª*<sub>*i*</sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)‚àí*u*(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)‚àí*Œ≤*max<sub>*a*‚Ä≤</sub>*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*S*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>)
3.  Set
    *œï*‚ÄÑ‚Üê‚ÄÑ*œï*‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖ*Œ≥*‚àá<sub>*œï*</sub>*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)*Œª*<sub>*i*</sub>

### Approximator

So far we haven't mentioned anything about the functional form of
*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>. The simple possible approximator is a linear one
*Q*(*S*,‚ÄÜ*a*)=*œï*‚Ä≤*S*. The linear approximator is simple and easy to
compute. Furthermore we know comparatively more about its convergence
properties (citation).

However, the flexibility of a linear function is quite limited, and in
many practical applications, a slightly more complex functional form is
chosen. This paper does the same. I take the *Q*<sub>*œï*</sub> to be a
simple feed forward neural network of the form:

$$
Q(S\_i,\\mathbf{a\_i})=\\sum\_{l=1}^L\\delta(\\phi\_l's\_l)
$$

Where *L* is the total number of layers, *Œ¥* is a non-linear function
(e.g. a sigmoid), *œï*<sub>*l*</sub> are the parameters at layer *l*, and
*s*<sub>1</sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ\[1,*S*<sub>*i*</sub>\]<sup>*T*</sup>. This is
illustrated below:

![Feed-forward Network](visuals/QNetowrk.png)

To update the weights of the network, we just use backpropagation,
starting with
*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)*Œª*<sub>*i*</sub>
at the outermost layer. As illustrated by the figure, we can convert the
output of the network directly to actions as per the definitions of the
previous section. This amounts to just setting the element in the action
vector, corresponding to the highest *Q* value to 1, and the others to
0.

DQN
---

The above section describes the classical vanilla version of Deep
Q-Learning. However, there are some known problems with this algorithm
(citation). Namely, the samples of state-utility sequences that the
agent encounters while interacting with the environment are highly
correlated (since they are taken from the same policy). Furthermore,
note that we calculate *y*<sub>*i*</sub> in the algorithm above
**before** taking the gradient of the *Q* network - in essence we are
optimizing to match a moving target. Both these problems hinder the
performance of deep Q-networks.

To fix this well known issues I introduce two ideas, first encountered
in (citation): the replay buffer, and the target network. The replay
buffer is nothing more than a collection of past interactions (think of
it as memory). When the network is updated we use not only the last
action, but a random sample from the replay buffer - that way the
Bellman errors will not be (as) correlated. We call the replay buffer ‚Ñ¨

The target network fixes the second issue, by creating a two networks -
one for choosing actions (*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>), and another for evaluating
them (*Q*<sub>*œï*‚Ä≤</sub>). This way when we update the parameters of the
network that does the choosing (*Q*<sub>*œï*</sub>) , the target is
actually fixed (i.e. the network that evaluates them
*Q*<sub>*œï*‚Ä≤</sub>). After a certain number of periods the current
choosing network becomes the new target.

The algorithm described above is known as "Deep Q Networks" (DQN). For
more details on it the reader is referred to (citation). To recap the
algorithm takes the form:

> 1.  Take action *a*<sub>*i*</sub>, record
>     (*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*S*‚Ä≤<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*u*(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>)).

Discussion
----------

The above section describes the learning algorithm for *one* policy
function. In our model each agent has at least two policy functions.
This means that the same algorithm will be implemented for each of them.
Note that each agent receives utility at most once per turn. In the
notation of the algorithm above, take
*u*(*S*<sub>*i*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*a*<sub>*i*</sub>) above to be the utility that
is received immediately after taking action *a*<sub>*i*</sub> and
*S*<sub>*i*</sub> to be the state of the economy at the time of the
decision.

A word about the state-space *S*: Since in the economy the complete
state includes the assets and liabilities of all agents, aggregate
capital and labor, factor prices, all individual policies, as well as
the history of those variables, no one agent will have access to the
entire state space at any given time. Instead agents observe a subset of
features *X*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ*S*. For example, when deciding whether to approve a loan
application, a bank will take into consideration: the firm's assets, the
characteristics of the project, the average market loan interest rate,
factor prices, its own assets and liabilities. All these characteristics
are flattened into a vector *X*, which is the input to the corresponding
*Q* function (a table with the feature space for each decision will be
provided in the appendix).

Finally, I want to motivate the choice of DQN as the agents learning
mechanism. First, it is worth noting that Bellman errors have been
linked to dopamine flows in the brain, and as such learning models based
on them have some support from neuroscience (citation - Niv 2009).
However, I should note, that many other reinforcement learning
algorithms also rely on them. DQNs also have the advantage of being
suited for discrete action spaces. This avoids a number of problems,
that may arise when dealing with continuous actions. It is for that
reason that the entire model is structured around discrete choices.

Last but not least, Q-Learning allows for seamless off-policy learning.
This means that agents can learn not only from their actions, but also
from the actions of other agents with the same choice sets. Since we are
dealing with an environment with a multitude of agents, this will prove
crucial.

In fact, I will assume that each agent can costlessly observe what is
happening to all other agents of its type (in terms of sequences of
actions and utility flows). So all agents learn using the same set of
observed interactions. This allows us to train one network per policy
type - meaning that all households for example, will have the sample
policy *œÄ*<sub>*w*</sub><sup>*h*</sup>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ*œÄ*<sub>*w*</sub> (and the same
Q-network associated with it). This allows us to significantly cut the
computational costs of simulating the model.
